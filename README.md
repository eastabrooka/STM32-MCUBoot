# STM32 Nucleo-L4A6ZG MCUboot Example (GCC/Make)

## About

This project sets up **MCUboot** on the **STM32 Nucleo-L4A6ZG** board.

It includes:

- A basic MCUboot bootloader (no encryption, no rollback).
- A simple application (blinky LED).
- GCC/Makefile build system.
- No STM32CubeMX, no Mbed, no HAL unless needed.
- Clean and simple setup to help understand MCUboot on STM32.

MCUboot is pulled directly from upstream as a Git submodule.

This project follows ideas from:
- [Memfault MCUboot Overview](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/mcuboot-overview)
- [MCUboot GitHub](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot)

## Flash Layout

Flash is divided like this:

| Region         | Start Address | Size    | Purpose              |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| Bootloader      | 0x08000000     | 32 KB   | MCUboot bootloader    |
| Primary Slot    | 0x08008000     | 128 KB  | Main application     |
| Secondary Slot  | 0x08028000     | 128 KB  | New firmware update  |

- No scratch area.
- Overwrite-only update mode.

## Build Instructions

-> Removed until I have a working example for now. 

Don't want to "Do a False Advertising ðŸ˜…"

Goals

âœ… Get MCUboot running on STM32 without CubeMX.

âœ… Learn how to manually manage flash layout, linker scripts, and memory offsets.

âœ… Use pure Makefiles and GCC, no extra bloat.

âœ… Build something simple first, then add security later if needed.
